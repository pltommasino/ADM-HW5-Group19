### Description of the project

All the points of the project are contained in a single main file called `HW5_main.ipynb`.

### 1. Data

In this part, we build the two graph: *Citation graph* and *Collaboration graph*. For this, we created a file (`dictionary.py` in the path `dict/`) which contained all the functions that allowed us to transform the dataset from *.json* to *dictionary*.

### 2. Controlling system

#### 2.1 Backend Implementation

In `funct/` path, we create five files (`functionality1.py`, `functionality2.py`, `functionality3.py`, `functionality4.py`, `functionality5.py`) for define all the Functionalities function, and then we import all the function in their respective section in the main file.

#### 2.2. Frontend Implementation

### 4. Command Line Question (CLQ)

In this part, the following 3 command line questions are answered using the AWS CloudShell;

1)Is there any node that acts as an important "connector" between the different parts of the graph?
2)How does the degree of citation vary among the graph nodes?
3)What is the average length of the shortest path among nodes?

### 5. Algorithmic Questions (AQ)
